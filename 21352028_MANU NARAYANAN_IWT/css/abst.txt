Abstract—Exposure bracketing is crucial to high dynamic
range imaging, but it is prone to halos for static scenes and
ghosting artifacts for dynamic scenes. The recently proposed
structural patch decomposition for multi-exposure fusion (SPDMEF) has achieved reliable performance in deghosting, but suffers from visible halo artifacts and is computationally expensive.
In addition, its relationship to other MEF methods is unclear.
We show that without explicitly performing structural patch
decomposition, we arrive at an unnormalized version of SPDMEF, which enjoys an order of 30× speed-up, and is closely
related to pixel-level MEF methods as well as the standard twolayer decomposition method for MEF. Moreover, we develop a
fast multi-scale SPD-MEF method, which can effectively reduce
halo artifacts. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness
of the proposed MEF method in terms of speed and quality.

V. CONCLUSION
We studied in-depth the structural patch decomposition
(SPD) method for MEF, and presented an unnormalized approximation of it, which speeds up SPD-MEF more than
30 times without sacrificing the MEF performance. We then
presented a multi-scale extension of SPD-MEF to effectively
reduce halo artifacts near strong edges. Quantitative and qualitative experiments on static and dynamic scenes validated the
advantages of the proposed fast multi-scale SPD-MEF method,
which provides a practical solution to fusing high-resolution
dynamic sequences on mobile devices
